# 🔥 Template Hell Base

A deliberately **over-engineered experimental base**, created as a **learning playground** to explore modern **C++20**, heavy template usage, and advanced design patterns.

This project intentionally pushes template usage *to absurd levels* in order to better understand compile-time abstraction, type safety, performance implications, and architecture design for large-scale mod menu frameworks.

> ⚠️ This base is **not intended for production use**.  
> It exists primarily for **education, experimentation, and suffering.**

## 🧠 Purpose

- Learn advanced **C++20**
- Explore **template metaprogramming**
- Experiment with **compile-time polymorphism**
- Build a modular **mod menu framework architecture**
- Suffer (productively)
